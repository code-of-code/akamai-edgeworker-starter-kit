# Optimizely Full Stack Feature Flags and Experimentation

[Optimizely Full Stack](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs) is a feature flagging and experimentation platform for websites, mobile     apps, chatbots, APIs, smart devices, and anything else with a network connection.

You can deploy code behind feature flags, experiment with A/B tests, and roll out or roll back features immediately. All of this functionality is available with minimal performance impact via easy-to-use, open source SDKs.


# Optimizely Starter Kit
The Optimizely starter kit for Akamai's Edge Workers embeds and extends our [Javascript SDK](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v4.0/docs/javascript-node) to provide a starting point for you to implement experimentation and feature flagging for your experiences at the edge. For a guide to getting started with our platform more generally, this can be combined with the steps outlined in our [Javascript Quickstart here](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v4.0/docs/javascript-node).
